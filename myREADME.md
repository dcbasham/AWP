This is my AsyncWeek Project

During the week I checked out:
-Cypress.io
-testing with Jest
-creating projects from scratch in vsCode, trying to use memory.
-creating projects with create-react-app
-using @mui library
-creating webpack config and using webpack-dev-server.
-using codeSandbox

-Although i don't have a whole lot to show --( because I got really frustrated with esLint, sequelize, and seeding and scrapped entire projects into the trash more than once ;)

\*\*\*see directories:
{
~/testing/BoilerPlate (using @mui components)
2206/asyncWk -->
(this one went fairly ok until i got to seeding data and making models and I wanted to switch focus back to react and the front end )
\*\* 2206/showhex (old version of this project before refactor)

};

I did learn a lot:

--more experience setting up .eslintrc.json files for projects being compiled by webpack/babel

-modern React usage and the transition to functional components, focusing on making my components more concise and using Hooks. I've mostly acclimated myself with the useState() hook and not manually setting state values.

-For this repo, in the process of codeSandboxing a ColorPicker component, and transitioning it into this project I found a color picking library I took advantage of : @uiw/react-color.
https://uiwjs.github.io/react-color/#/

although i do enjoy learning by doing
I learned the value of:

- don't fix what's not already broken- it's definently easier and more time-conscious to start with something that is already functional and tweak it to suit my purposes.
  AND
  -using codeSandbox to test ideas instead of testing code in vsCode and having to setup an entire project, server etc. and look at it in the browser.
  \*\*\* see codesandbox.io sandboxes
  -- writing tests before writing code is very important and will actually help me write better code by having a clear direction and expected outcome.! I'd like to focus more on that next.
