              A very cool color picker component available as an npm package
              that I discovered when I was developing my project. The first
              version was a simple class component I developed on my own while
              consulting a book called "Learning React: A Hands-On Guide to
              building Web Applications Using React and Redux" by Kirupa
              Chinnathambi. It had an input to type a color and showed a color
              on the card. I love websites like coolors.co that behave as color
              generators for hex codes so I decided to develop something similar
              and used react-color's Sketch component.

              Testing with cypress was a little more difficult than I thought
              but it would be a great resource to learn how to use for testing
              react components. Along these lines I also explored Jest and the
              React testing library.{' '}

              So many things used in here from Material UI but I'd highlight
              working with menus, containers and photos.

              although i do enjoy learning by doing I learned the value of
              testing and playing with a project in CodeSandBox before writing
              code in my editor. It's definently easier and more time-conscious
              to test and develop direction with something that is already
              functional.
